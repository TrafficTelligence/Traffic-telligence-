Connected mobility is in a state of constant evolution. As a result, the mobility landscape is experiencing a period of extensive transformation.

For example, approximately half of all vehicles sold today are connected to the internet. This has created a marketplace for vehicle data and enables around 75% of people to rely on navigation apps, particularly when faced with congestion.

 

Legislative and public investment in this data has focused on mobility. Numerous countries are now adapting their laws to recognise the value of this data for mobility management. The emergence of traffic intelligence as a strategic sector is clear with initiatives such as the European Union’s ITS Directives, the Common European Data Spaces, and similar initiatives in the US.

Considering this evolving connected mobility ecosystem public administrations recognize the urgent need for new traffic intelligent solutions which use vehicle data to enable them to drive positive change through data-driven traffic management.

Data-driven decisions for a dynamic mobility
Kapsch's traffic intelligence solutions harness specialized data management technologies to deliver valuable insights and data-driven mobility planning. 

Featuring predictive capabilities and early detection of incidents, we enable agencies to transition from reactive to proactive operations. This minimizes congestion and much of the impact caused by unexpected events.

The scalability and openness of our solutions enable traffic agencies to start small and grow progressively, supporting their long-term vision for traffic management improvement. It is a transformative approach which empowers public agencies to make data-driven decisions which enhance traffic flow whilst improving safety and sustainability.

Intersections are the neuralgic point of the road infrastructure. All types of mobility come into contact with each other here, which of course also increases the risk of accidents. The potential of Connected Vehicle technology for accident avoidance and traffic improvement is huge – regardless of whether you're in a car, on a bike or on your own two legs.
