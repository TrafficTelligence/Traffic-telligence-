Connected mobility is in a state of constant evolution. As a result, the mobility landscape is experiencing a period of extensive transformation.

For example, approximately half of all vehicles sold today are connected to the internet. This has created a marketplace for vehicle data and enables around 75% of people to rely on navigation apps, particularly when faced with congestion.

 

Legislative and public investment in this data has focused on mobility. Numerous countries are now adapting their laws to recognise the value of this data for mobility management. The emergence of traffic intelligence as a strategic sector is clear with initiatives such as the European Union’s ITS Directives, the Common European Data Spaces, and similar initiatives in the US.

Considering this evolving connected mobility ecosystem public administrations recognize the urgent need for new traffic intelligent solutions which use vehicle data to enable them to drive positive change through data-driven traffic management.

Data-driven decisions for a dynamic mobility
Kapsch's traffic intelligence solutions harness specialized data management technologies to deliver valuable insights and data-driven mobility planning. 

Featuring predictive capabilities and early detection of incidents, we enable agencies to transition from reactive to proactive operations. This minimizes congestion and much of the impact caused by unexpected events.

The scalability and openness of our solutions enable traffic agencies to start small and grow progressively, supporting their long-term vision for traffic management improvement. It is a transformative approach which empowers public agencies to make data-driven decisions which enhance traffic flow whilst improving safety and sustainability.

Intersections are the neuralgic point of the road infrastructure. All types of mobility come into contact with each other here, which of course also increases the risk of accidents. The potential of Connected Vehicle technology for accident avoidance and traffic improvement is huge – regardless of whether you're in a car, on a bike or on your own two legs.

Our solution is built upon three pillars which, together, deliver intelligent, proactive traffic management.

Prediction
We use machine-learning data prediction models applicable to traffic and mobility data. Tailored for urban and inter-urban environments, these enable proactive decisions and actions to be taken based on anticipated behaviours.

Detection
Early detection plays a fundamental role in enhancing operations. To achieve this, our solution incorporates connectors to automatically integrate information from connected vehicles and from drivers. Meanwhile, machine-learning technologies generate specific anomaly detection models to identify significant deviations from expected patterns.
 

Automation
Our traffic intelligence solutions integrate prediction and detection information with the Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) which includes a Decision Support System (DSS). As a result, programmed actions and outputs can be automatically triggered by specific conditions and input data.

Traffic intelligence in action
Our traffic Intelligence solutions are suited to both urban and interurban environments, offering customizable modules to suit specific customer needs.

Kapsch's unique traffic intelligence solution
At the heart of our traffic intelligence capability is our unique and revolutionary traffic intelligence platform. Based on a common data model developed by Kapsch TrafficCom which has been uniquely designed to support traffic and mobility, it facilitates both data sharing and the reuse of data analytics functionalities.

The solution includes a specialized data communications layer which has been uniquely optimized for handling traffic and mobility information. Its expandable and open design promotes seamless management and sharing of real-time and historical data, enabling it to become the foundation for an open and adaptable traffic and mobility data solution.

Once the data is appropriately managed, standardized, and linked to a common reference system, comprehensive analysis becomes possible. This empowers data-driven decision-making. We provide a set of out-of-the-box data analytics use cases which deliver valuable traffic intelligence from day one. These insights empower enhanced traffic planning, encompassing descriptive analytics (‘what happened?) and diagnostic analytics (‘why did it happen?). They also facilitate the analysis of traffic and mobility demand and use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
